# Automatic-UPass-Registration
Tired of registering for UPass every month? Good!
I present to you, a solution!
This script will automatically register for your upass when run.
However, if you have MFA enabled. Some user input is still required.

# How To Run?
I'm working on converting this python script into an .exe for ease of use for you, the user. 
But for now, I am assuming you have downloaded at least python 3.8

## Step 1.
Git clone this repo into your favourite folder! 

## Step 2.
Lets get dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Step 3.
Nice. now run main.py in your command prompt.
```python main.py```

## Step 5.
Now. Follow the script's instructions!

## Step 5b.

Find your browser's shortcut (probably on your Desktop)

Right click, select `Open file location`.
